## NYC Clean Heat program:
### The NYC Clean Heat program encourages residents, workers and other individuals to pursue sustainable heating and cooling that doesn’t harm the environment. Through the Clean Heat program, the installment of cold climate air source heat pumps (ASHP), energy efficient ground source heat pumps (GSHP), along with heat pump water heaters (HPWH), heat pumps provide more convenience and eco-friendly alternatives. A No.4 fuel (Bunker A)  is a type of residual fuel oil that is used for commercial burner installations in industrial plants that do not have preheating equipment. To use this fuel, it has to be preheated to 40-60 degrees Celsius. This type of fuel is a blend of distillate (lighter oils) and residual (heavier oils) fuel but is more heavily distillate. A No.6 fuel (Bunker C) is a heavy fuel that is used for power plants that burn oil, fuel for ocean liners and tankers, and for steam-powered vessels. To use this fuel, it has to be preheated to 104-127 degrees Celsius. This type of fuel is very viscous and sticky which makes it ideal for skimming operations overseas. The DEP Boiler Registration was created to monitor and minimize the amount of soot pollution that is going into the air. DEP Boiler Registration came about because the older buildings in NYC were generating loads of soot, blackening buildings, which not only cost owners money to clean but consumed by residents who are breathing in the toxic air. The Greener Greater Buildings Plan is a set of energy efficiency laws meant to target a set of buildings in NYC that is responsible for 45% of the entire city’s energy usage.

## NYC Emissions:
### NYC’s greenhouse gas emissions are made up almost entirely from the combustion of fossil fuels. Due to global warming, more and more people around the world are turning to air conditioning (AC) units to keep themselves and their homes/buildings cool. As NYC is prominent for large urban building structures rather than smaller rural areas, such installations like AC and Heating are required to avoid the residents residing in the buildings from sickness. Combustion of natural gas and petroleum from cooking emits carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Emissions from the production and consumption of food are the third largest contributing factor to NYC’s greenhouse emissions. Brooklyn’s environmental issues have progressively worsened as many areas of the borough are being polluted. The Gowanus Canal is a notoriously polluted 1.8-mile waterway extending from Gowanus to Red Hook. The canal has been a factory chemical dumping ground with an inherent history of pollution and neglect. Pollution caused by fossil fuel-powered peaker plants - power plants that supplement the energy supply in “peak” consumption times, like summer—negatively affects the health of New Yorkers who live within a one-mile radius. In Brooklyn, the plants are sited in the historically working-class communities like Red Hook and Williamsburg.
