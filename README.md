## HC 3: NYC Clean Heat Program Overview
### The NYC Clean Heat program encourages residents, workers and other individuals to pursue sustainable heating and cooling that doesn’t harm the environment. Through the Clean Heat program, the installment of cold climate air source heat pumps (ASHP), energy efficient ground source heat pumps (GSHP), along with heat pump water heaters (HPWH), heat pumps provide more convenience and eco-friendly alternatives. A No.4 fuel (Bunker A)  is a type of residual fuel oil that is used for commercial burner installations in industrial plants that do not have preheating equipment. To use this fuel, it has to be preheated to 40-60 degrees Celsius. This type of fuel is a blend of distillate (lighter oils) and residual (heavier oils) fuel but is more heavily distillate. A No.6 fuel (Bunker C) is a heavy fuel that is used for power plants that burn oil, fuel for ocean liners and tankers, and for steam-powered vessels. To use this fuel, it has to be preheated to 104-127 degrees Celsius. This type of fuel is very viscous and sticky which makes it ideal for skimming operations overseas. The DEP Boiler Registration was created to monitor and minimize the amount of soot pollution that is going into the air. DEP Boiler Registration came about because the older buildings in NYC were generating loads of soot, blackening buildings, which not only cost owners money to clean but consumed by residents who are breathing in the toxic air. The Greener Greater Buildings Plan is a set of energy efficiency laws meant to target a set of buildings in NYC that is responsible for 45% of the entire city’s energy usage.

## HC 4: NYC Emissions Report
### NYC’s greenhouse gas emissions are made up almost entirely from the combustion of fossil fuels. Due to global warming, more and more people around the world are turning to air conditioning (AC) units to keep themselves and their homes/buildings cool. As NYC is prominent for large urban building structures rather than smaller rural areas, such installations like AC and Heating are required to avoid the residents residing in the buildings from sickness. Combustion of natural gas and petroleum from cooking emits carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Emissions from the production and consumption of food are the third largest contributing factor to NYC’s greenhouse emissions. Brooklyn’s environmental issues have progressively worsened as many areas of the borough are being polluted. The Gowanus Canal is a notoriously polluted 1.8-mile waterway extending from Gowanus to Red Hook. The canal has been a factory chemical dumping ground with an inherent history of pollution and neglect. Pollution caused by fossil fuel-powered peaker plants - power plants that supplement the energy supply in “peak” consumption times, like summer—negatively affects the health of New Yorkers who live within a one-mile radius. In Brooklyn, the plants are sited in the historically working-class communities like Red Hook and Williamsburg.

## HC 7 & 8: Data Exploration & Analysis 
### Calculating Ocean Parkway's average fuel uasge by primary fuel
### We observe...
![OP Primary Fuel Usage](https://github.com/angelinanur/angelinanur.github.io/assets/148802527/fa660fda-a68d-42a2-b020-4d7794b04fff)
### This graph demonstrates the relation between the Fuel Usage in Ocean Parkway to primary fuel. From the graph, we can observe that although both No. 4 and No. 6 are relatively used equally, No. 4 fuel is corroborating slightly more to the higher fuel usage in Ocean Parkway. However, these numbers could drastically change as No. 6 fuel oil has been creating far more environmental destruction in other neighborhoods like Flatbush and Brooklyn Heights.

### Now, moving onto the next diagram... we can determine how fueler usage corroborates with the total # of units in each building.
![OP Total Units](https://github.com/angelinanur/angelinanur.github.io/assets/148802527/05447d54-a146-4b96-abdb-ca11290e288a)
### What can be observed through the diagram is exactly what you would expect, the more units each building contains, the higher the fuel usage is. This is conveyed in the graph through the highest number of units (113 units) consuming the largest fuel usage. What was unexpected from the data was the total units containing only 1 unit. In the graph, it is portrayed how many buildings with 1 unit consume more fuel usage than 36, 41, 47, 55, and 59 units.

### Next, we will determine how Fuel Usage has truly fluctuated over the years, looking out for any patterns that might emerge in the data as well.
![OP Year Built](https://github.com/angelinanur/angelinanur.github.io/assets/148802527/00dd7f7a-fc3e-4ce6-97b6-2e5351912eac)
### According to the graph, fuel usage before the 1930's demonstrated steep decreases which changed during 1930 where there was a slight increase in fuel usage. However, the increase did not last for long as between 1933 to 1937, a drastic decrease occurred, followed by a heavier drastic increase from 1937 to the 1950's. This suggests how although fuel usage has fluctuated over the years, ultimately in the end, the fuel usage in Ocean Parkway has continued to rise without any decreases.

### Additionally, the exploration of the relation between Fuel Usage and the Age range of Boilers can contribute to further understanding regarding what is causing higher Fuel Usage.
![OP Boiler Age Range](https://github.com/angelinanur/angelinanur.github.io/assets/148802527/1886833e-47b6-4d39-8c6d-0fd9597ddaec)
### As expected, older boilers such as the boiler age of 1927 is portrayed to have the largest total fuel usage. However, what seems to be growing in the ranks of fuel usage by boiler age is 1950,  due to more buildings being functional over the years as the population of Ocean Parkway progresses. Furthermore as the new boilers are starting to produce more fuels, this could be explained with more buildings starting to use No. 6 fuel oils along with No. 4 fuel oils.

#### Based on the research conducted from the previous HC assignments we observe such claims that were created to be true from our various graphs. These diagrams convey visual representation of the research from HC 2-4, demonstrating how fuel usage is affecting our neighborhoods. From our knowledge regarding the NYC Clean Heat Program in HC 3, we encountered the Types of Fuel Oils (No. 4 and No. 6), where No. 6 was revealed to create more environmental destruction due to it being heavy fuel for power plants and ships. Such claims from our research are proven to be correct, as in the neighborhoods in Brooklyn such as Flatbush, Brooklyn Heights, Ocean Parkway, and Borough Park convey the No. 6 type fuel oil contributing to equal or higher fuel usage. Brooklyn is one of the newer boroughs, which could attribute to its lower usage compared to other boroughs. Furthermore, from HC 3 the DEP Boiler Registration contributes to the older buildings in NYC generating loads of soot, blackening buildings, and consumed by residents who are breathing in the toxic air.
